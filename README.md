## Introduction 
This project was developed as part of a university project.
This project implements a 3D rendering system using OpenGL, The system estimates camera poses based on 2D-3D correspondences using the EPnP algorithm and provides a visual overlay of the results.


## Outcome
Below are some photos showcasing the results of our 3D rendering and pose estimation system:

## Setup:
To run this project, you'll need to have OpenGL and a C++ development environment.The project is configured to work with the EPnP algorithm for pose estimation.

## Usage:
After compiling the project, use the WASD keys for movement and the arrow keys for camera rotation. Press 'B' to capture images and 'R' to process and estimate camera poses.
